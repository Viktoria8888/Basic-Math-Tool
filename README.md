## Polynomials
The program takes the list of coefficients as an argument and performs different functions on it. In particular,
* 1) Converts an expanded polynomial to a factored polynomial.

* 2) Generates a graph of a polynomial in a specified range.

* 3) Determines the maximum and minimum global values.

* 4) Returns all the polynomial roots in expanded form within a given range and with a given approximation.

5)
